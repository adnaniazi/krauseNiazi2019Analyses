## 2. Krause/Niazi et al. RNA data
For RNA data, we obtained two replicates using SQK-RNA001 sequencing kit, and a third replicate (after receiving the reviews) using SQK-RNA002 kit. Replicates using SQK-RNA001 had the reverse transcription step, whereas the SQK-RNA002 replicate was obtained by omitting this step.

# Column descriptions
#### tailfindr CSV files
1. read_id: Read ID
2. read_type: Whether the read is poly(A)/poly(T) or invalid. Only reported for DNA datasets.
3. tail_is_valid: Whether a poly(A)-tailed read is a full-length read or not. This is important because a poly(A) tail is at the end of the read, and premature termination of reads is prevelant in cDNA. Only reported for DNA datasets.
4. tail_start: Sample index of start site of the tail in raw data
5. tail_end: Sample index of end site of the tail in raw data
