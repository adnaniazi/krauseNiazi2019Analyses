## R Markdown files 

This direcotry contains all the R Markdown files for generating figure used in the tailfindr manuscript.

When you run `drake::r_make()`, it will first download the data, consolidate the data, and then knit the R Markdown files -- present in this directory -- using the consolidated data. The html output of the R Markdown files is stored here with the same name as the R Markdown file. 

## Modifiying R Markdown file to include custom analyses

After you have successfully run `drake::r_make()`, you can change these R Markdown files to inlcude custom analyses. To render the modified R Markdown file, either run `drake::r_make()` again, which will automatically knit the modified R Markdown file(s), or just use the 'knit' option in R Studio.
